# Audiobook-Project-with-Python
### What you can do through this code? ###
* You can convert text to speech from any PDF which uses the English language
* You can create audiobook and save that audiobook file as mp3. Isn't that amazing?

### Information regarding the GUI I used here ###
* [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

### The additional libraries I have used here to complete my project ###
* [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)
* [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)

### How to run
  * Execute the PythonSourceCode.py file
  * A GUI pallet will open click on "Browse and select the PDF file you want to process" button a dialog box will open which will ask to select a PDF File.
  * Select the PDF file you want to process.
  * It will then narrate the PDF file entirely and then will store the audiobook generated from the same PDF file in the current directory itself.
  * The name of the audiobook file generated will be "Audiobook.mp3".
